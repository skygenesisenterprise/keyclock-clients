## Close Button

The `CloseButton` component is a lightweight, themeable button used for closing notifications or
dismissing elements. It is built using the `lit` library, styled with `@emotion/css`, and integrates
a close icon for visual clarity. The component is designed to be intuitive and accessible.

   - `lit`: Used to render the component.
   - `@emotion/css`: Used for styling the component.

   - `handleCloseNotification`: A function that handles the click event for closing.
   - `theme`: The theme to style the button (must be a valid `Theme`).

## Accessibility (WCAG) Compliance

The `CloseButton` component follows the
[W3C ARIA button pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/). Below is a breakdown of
key accessibility considerations:

### Keyboard Accessibility

- The button supports keyboard interaction through the `@click` event.
- Users can activate the button using the `Enter` or `Space` key.

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- The button uses a semantic `<button>` element, ensuring it is natively recognized by assistive
  technologies.

### Focus Management

- Ensure the button receives proper focus, especially when navigating using a keyboard.

### Visual Feedback

- The button provides hover feedback by changing the border color for better user interaction.
