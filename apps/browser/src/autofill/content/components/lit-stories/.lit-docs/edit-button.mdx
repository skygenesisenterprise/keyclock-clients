## Edit Button

The `EditButton` component is a small, themeable button that integrates an editable pencil icon to
represent edit functionality. It is built using the `lit` library and styled with `@emotion/css`.
The component supports themes, click events, and a disabled state, making it ideal for use in forms
or settings where inline editing is required.

## Installation and Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   - `lit`: Used to render the component.
   - `@emotion/css`: Used for styling the component.

2. Pass the required props to the component when rendering:
   - `buttonAction`: A function that handles the click event.
   - `buttonText`: The text displayed as a tooltip for the button.
   - `disabled` (optional): A boolean indicating whether the button is disabled.
   - `theme`: The theme to style the button (must be a valid `Theme`).

## Accessibility (WCAG) Compliance

The `EditButton` component follows the
[W3C ARIA button pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/). Below is a breakdown of
key accessibility considerations:

### Keyboard Accessibility

- The button supports keyboard interaction through the `@click` event.
- Users can activate the button using the `Enter` or `Space` key.

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- The `title` attribute is dynamically set to the button's text (`buttonText`), ensuring it is read
  by screen readers.
- The semantic `<button>` element is used, which is natively recognized by assistive technologies.

### Focus Management

- Ensure the button receives proper focus, especially when navigating using a keyboard.

### Visual Feedback

- The button provides hover feedback by changing the border color for better user interaction.
