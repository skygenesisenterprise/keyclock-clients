# windows-plugin-authenticator

This is an internal crate that's meant to be a safe abstraction layer over the generated Rust bindings for the Windows WebAuthn Plugin Authenticator API's.

This crate is very much a WIP and is not ready for internal use.

You can find more information about the Windows WebAuthn API's [here](https://github.com/microsoft/webauthn).
