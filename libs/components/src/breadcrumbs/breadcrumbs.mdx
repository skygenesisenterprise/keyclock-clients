## Display

Breadcrumbs display above the page title. The current page should not appear as a breadcrumb link.
See [Header with Breadcrumbs](?path=/story/web-header--with-breadcrumbs).

### Top Level

When a user is 1 level deep into a tree, the top level is displayed as a single link above the page
title.

<Canvas of={stories.TopLevel} />

### Second Level

When a user is 2 or more levels deep into a tree, the top level is displayed followed by an

<i class="bwi bwi-angle-right"></i> icon, and the following pages.

<Canvas of={stories.SecondLevel} />

### Overflow

When a user is several levels deep into a tree, the top level or 2 are displayed followed by an

<i class="bwi bwi-ellipsis-h"> </i> icon button, and then the page directly above the current page.

When the user selects the <i class="bwi bwi-ellipsis-h"></i> icon button, a menu opens displaying
the pages between the top level and the previous page.

<Canvas of={stories.Overflow} />

### Small screens

If a screen's width is not large enough to display the full breadcrumb path, display a link to the
previous page and an <i class="bwi bwi-angle-right"></i> icon to take the user back to the previous
page.
