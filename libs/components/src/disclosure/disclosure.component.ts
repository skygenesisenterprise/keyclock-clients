/**
  * The `bit-disclosure` component is used in tandem with the `bitDisclosureTriggerFor` directive to create an accessible content area whose visibility is controlled by a trigger button.

  * To compose a disclosure and trigger:

  * 1. Create a trigger component (see "Supported Trigger Components" section below)
  * 2. Create a `bit-disclosure`
  * 3. Set a template reference on the `bit-disclosure`
  * 4. Use the `bitDisclosureTriggerFor` directive on the trigger component, and pass it the `bit-disclosure` template reference
  * 5. Set the `open` property on the `bit-disclosure` to init the disclosure as either currently expanded or currently collapsed. The disclosure will default to `false`, meaning it defaults to being hidden.
  *
  * @example
  *
  * ```html
  * <button
  *   type="button"
  *   bitIconButton="bwi-sliders"
  *   [buttonType]="'muted'"
  *   [bitDisclosureTriggerFor]="disclosureRef"
  * ></button>
  * <bit-disclosure #disclosureRef open>click button to hide this content</bit-disclosure>
  * ```
  *
