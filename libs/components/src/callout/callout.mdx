## Styles

Icons should remain consistent across these types. Do not change the icon without consulting a
designer. Use the following guidelines to help choose the correct type of callout.

### Success

Use the success callout to communicate a positive messaging to the user.

**Example:** a positive report results shows a success callout.

The success callout may also be used for the information related to a premium membership. In this
case, replace the icon with <i class="bwi bwi-star" title="bwi-star" aria-label="bwi-star"></i>

<Canvas of={stories.Success} />

### Info

Use an info callout to call attention to important information the user should be aware of, but has
low risk of the user receiving and unintended or irreversible results if they do not read the
information.

**Example:** in the Domain Claiming modal, an info callout is used to tell the user the domain will
automatically be checked.

<Canvas of={stories.Info} />

### Warning

Use a warning callout if the user is about to perform an action that may have unintended or
irreversible results.

**Example:** the warning callout is used before the change master password and encryption key form
to alert the user that they will be logged out.

<Canvas of={stories.Warning} />

### Danger

Use the danger callout to communicate an action the user is about to take is dangerous and typically
not reversible.

The danger callout can also be used to alert the user of an error or errors, such as a server side
errors after form submit or failed communication request.

<Canvas of={stories.Danger} />

## Accessibility

Use the `role=”alert”` only if the callout is appearing on a page after the user takes an action. If
the content is static, do not use the alert role. This will cause a screen reader to announce the
callout content on page load.

Ensure the title's color contrast remains WCAG compliant with the callout's background.
