# Typography

The `bitTypography` directive applies text styles to its host element.

```html
<h1 bitTypography="h1">H1</h1>
```

For headings, note that the semantic element and the text style may not always be in sync:

```html
<h2 bitTypography="h5">Semantically, I am an h2, but I use h5 styles.</h2>
```

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />
