## Labels

Always display a label to provide a text based description of what the indicator is measuring. This
allows those who may not be familiar with the pattern to be able to read and digest the information.
It also allows assistive technology to accurately describe the indicator to those who may be unable
to see part or all of the indicator.

<Canvas of={stories.Full} />

## Text label

When measuring something other than progress, such as password strength, update the label to fit the
context of the implementation.

<Canvas of={stories.CustomText} />

### Strength indicator styles

For a strength indicator use the following styles for fill:

- **Weak:** `danger-600`
- **Weak2:** `warning-600`
- **Good:** `primary-600`
- **Strong:** `success-600`

## Accessibility

Be sure to include the proper `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` attributes. An
a`ria-valuetext` should also be configurable to include the text a screen reader should read to the
user.

In the case of a password strength indicator; `aria-describedby` is used on the password field and
points to the `id` of the progress bar. This results in the screen reader reading the password
strength to the user after they finish typing.
