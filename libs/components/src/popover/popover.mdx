# Popover

A popover is a page overlay that is triggered by a selecting a button. It displays interactive
content.

Popovers remain actively open until a user dismisses it in one of the following ways:

- Presses the Esc key
- Presses the close "x" button in the Popover
- Presses a button within the Popover triggering close
- Clicks outside of the Popover

Popovers are used to provide the user with additional context about an interaction or page. We
primarily use popovers when a user clicks on an icon-button with a question icon. This launches a
popover that provides the user with in app help text.

Note: Popovers are not tooltips. Use tooltips to show a short text to respondents when they hover
over a word or icon. Use popovers to show a longer text, or when you want to link to an external web
page.

## Implementation Notes

The popover should have even spacing above and below the content. If you are using element(s) inside
the popover that have built-in bottom margin, please remove the bottom margin on the last element.

## Open on Page Load

A Popover can be set to initially open on page load by setting `[popoverOpen]="true"` on the trigger
element, like so:

```html
<button [bitPopoverTriggerFor]="myPopover" [popoverOpen]="true">Open Popover</button>
```

## Positions

The Popover component uses the following list of default "positions" to determine where to position
the Popover overlay.

1. right-start ---> "Open the Popover to the RIGHT of the trigger and align the START of the Popover
   with the trigger"
2. right-center
3. right-end
4. left-start
5. left-center
6. left-end
7. below-start
8. below-center
9. below-end
10. above-start
11. above-center
12. above-end

The order here matters. If position 1 fits within the viewport, it will be used. If it does not, the
Popover component will try position 2, and so forth. This cascading behavior ensures that if the
user resizes the screen, the Popover component will find the best way to reposition itself.

### Example

Suppose you have a trigger element on the right side of the page. The `right-start` position will
not work because there is not enough space to open the Popover to the right. The same is true for
`right-center` and `right-end`.

The first position that "fits" is `left-start`, and therefore that is where the Popover will open.

### Manually Setting a Position

You can manually set the initial position of the Popover by binding a `[position]` input on the
Popover's trigger element, such as:

```html
<button [bitPopoverTriggerFor]="myPopover" [position]="'above-end'">Open Popover</button>
```

<Canvas of={stories.AboveEnd} />

Note that if the user resizes the page and the Popover no longer fits in the viewport, the Popover
component will fall back to the list of default positions to find the best position.

To test this out, open the Popopver in the example above and then slowly resize your browser window
horizontally to make it smaller. When the Popover no longer fits the `above-end` position, it will
jump down below the trigger, using `below-center`, because that is the first position that fits
based on the list of default positions.
