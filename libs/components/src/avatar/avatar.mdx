## Background color

The Background color can be set 3 ways. The color is generated using the following order of
priority:

- Color
- ID
- Text, usually set to the user's Name field

<Canvas of={stories.ColorByText} />
Use the user 'ID' field if `Name` is not defined.
<Canvas of={stories.ColorByID} />

## Outline

If the avatar is displayed on one of the theme's `background` color variables or is interactive,
display the avatar with a 1 pixel `secondary-600` border to meet WCAG AA graphic contrast guidelines
for interactive elements.

<Canvas of={stories.Border} />

## Avatar as a button

The Avatar can be used as a button.

Typically this is only in the navigation on client apps where account switching is used and in the
web app for the account menu indicator.

When the avatar is used as a button, the following states should be used:

`TODO:` [Jira add stories](https://bitwarden.atlassian.net/browse/CL-101) for button avatars.
