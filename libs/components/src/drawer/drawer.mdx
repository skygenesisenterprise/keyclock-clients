# Drawer

**Note: `bit-drawer` is deprecated. Use `bit-dialog` and `DialogService.openDrawer(...)` instead.**

A drawer is a panel of supplementary content that is adjacent to the page's main content.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Usage

A `bit-drawer` in a template will not render inline, but rather will render adjacent to the main
page content.

```html
<bit-drawer [open]="true">
  <bit-drawer-header title="Hello Bitwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarden!"></bit-drawer-header>
  <bit-drawer-body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor...</p>
  </bit-drawer-body>
</bit-drawer>
```

`bit-drawer` must be a descendant of `bit-layout`, but it does not need to be a direct descendant.

## Header and body

Header and body content can be provided with the `bit-drawer-header` and `bit-drawer-body`
components, respectively.

A title can be passed to the header by input:
`<bit-drawer-header title="Foobar"></bit-drawer-header>`

Custom content can be rendered before the title with the header's `start` slot:

```html
<bit-drawer-header title="Foobar">
  <i slot="start" class="bwi bwi-key" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</bit-drawer-header>
```

## Opening and closing

`bit-drawer` opens when its `open` input is `true`:

```html
<bit-drawer [open]="true">...</bit-drawer>
```

Note: Model inputs do not support implicit boolean transformation (see Angular reasoning
[here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55166#issuecomment-2032150999)). `open` must be
bound explicitly `<bit-drawer [open]="true">` instead of just `<bit-drawer open>`.

Buttons can be made to open/toggle drawers by referencing a template variable, or by manipulating
state that is bound to `open`:

```html
<button (click)="myDrawer.toggle()"></button> <bit-drawer #myDrawer>...</bit-drawer>
```

For convenience, close buttons can be created _inside_ the drawer with the `bitDrawerClose`
directive:

```html
<bit-drawer>
  <button type="button" bitDrawerClose>Close</button>
</bit-drawer>
```

## Multiple Drawers

Only one drawer can be open at a time, and they do not stack. If a drawer is already open, opening
another will close and replace the one already open.

## Headless

Omitting `bit-drawer-header` and `bit-drawer-body` allows for fully customizable content.

<Canvas of={stories.Headless} />

## Accessibility

- The drawer should contain an h2 element. If you are using `bit-drawer-header`, this is created for
  you via the `title` input:

```html
<bit-drawer>
  <h2 bitTypography="h2">Hello world!</h2>
</bit-drawer>

<!-- or -->

<bit-drawer>
  <bit-drawer-header title="Hello world!"></bit-drawer-header>
</bit-drawer>
```

- The ARIA role of the drawer can be set with the `role` attribute:
  - [complementary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/complementary_role)
    (default)
    - For drawers that contain content that is complementary to the page's main content.
  - [navigation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/navigation_role)
    - For drawers that primary contain links to other content.
