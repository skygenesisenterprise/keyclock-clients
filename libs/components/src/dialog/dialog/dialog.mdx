# Dialog

Dialogs are used throughout the app to help the user focus on a specific action. Use this dialog
component when content exceeds 384px width or there are a high number of interactive elements
needed. **Example:** The web app's edit vault item form dialog

For alerts or simple confirmation actions, like speedbumps, use the
[Simple Dialog](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-simple-dialog--docs).

Dialogs's should be used sparingly as they do call extra attention to themselves and can be
interruptive if overused.

## Size

There are 3 main dialog sizes:

### Large

Use the large size for dialogs that have many interactive elements or tabbed content.

**Tailwind styling:**

`max-w-3xl` 48rem

<Canvas of={stories.Large} />

### Default

Use the Default size for most dialogs that require some content and a few interactive elements.
**Example:** master password confirmation dialog

**Tailwind styling:**

`max-w-xl` 36rem

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Small

**Tailwind styling:**

`max-w-sm` 24rem

<Canvas of={stories.Small} />

## Long Title

If a dialog's title is too long to fully display. It should be truncated and on hover shown in a
tooltip.

<Canvas of={stories.LongTitle} />

## Loading

Similar to a page loading state, a Dialog that takes more than a few seconds to load should use a
loading state.

<Canvas of={stories.Loading} />

## Tab Content

Use tabs to separate related content within a dialog.

<Canvas of={stories.TabContent} />

## Background Color

The `background` input can be set to `alt` to change the background color. This is useful for
dialogs that contain multiple card sections.

<Canvas of={stories.WithCards} />
