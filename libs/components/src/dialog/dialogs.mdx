# Dialog

Dialogs are used throughout the app to help the user focus on a specific action.

Use the main [Dialog Component](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-dialog--docs). when content
exceeds 384px width or there are a high number of interactive elements needed. **Example:** The web
app's edit vault item form dialog

For alerts or simple confirmation actions, like speedbumps, use the
[Simple Dialog](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-simple-dialog--docs).

Dialogs's should be used sparingly as they do call extra attention to themselves and can be
interruptive if overused.

For non-blocking, supplementary content, open dialogs as a
[Drawer](?path=/story/component-library-dialogs-service--drawer) (requires `bit-layout`).

## Placement

Dialogs should be centered vertically and horizontally on screen. Dialogs height should expand to
fit its content until there are 2rems of margin on the top/bottom of the dialog; in this case, the
dialog should become scrollable.

A backdrop should be used to hide the content below the dialog. Use `#000000` with `30% opacity`.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Accessibility

### Component behavior

- Dialog include `role="dialog"`
- The Dialog title is an `<h1>`
- A user should not be able to tab focus outside of the Dialog until it has been closed.
- Clicking outside the dialog or clicking escape should close the dialog (this prevents a keyboard
  trap)

### Required per implementation

The triggering button should indicate to assistive technology that additional content will open or
appear when the trigger is selected. Consider using `aria-haspopup="true"`

Dialog title should be announced by a screen reader when launched. Consider using `aria-labelledby`
or `aria-label`

When opened, focus should follow the visual order of the popoverâ€™s focusable content. Typically
focus is moved to the close button, but it is acceptable to move focus to the first interactive
element after close since a user may not want to close the dialog immediately if there are
additional interactive elements. See
[WCAG Focus Order success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html)

Once closed, focus should remain on the element which triggered the Dialog.

**Note:** If a Simple Dialog is triggered from a main Dialog, be sure to make sure focus is moved to
the Simple Dialog.
