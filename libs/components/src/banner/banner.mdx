## Types

Icons should remain consistent across these types. Do not change the icon without consulting
designers.

Use the following guidelines to help choose the correct type of banner.

### Premium

<Canvas of={stories.Premium} />

Used primarily to encourage user to upgrade to premium.

### Info

<Canvas of={stories.Info} />

Used to communicate release notes, server maintenance or other informative event.

### Warning

<Canvas of={stories.Warning} />

Used to alert the user of outdated info or versions.

### Danger

<Canvas of={stories.Danger} />

Rarely used, but may be used to alert users over critical messages or very outdated versions.

## Accessibility

Banners sets the `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` attributes to ensure screen readers
announce the content prior to the test of the page. This behavior can be disabled by setting
`[useAlertRole]="false"`.
