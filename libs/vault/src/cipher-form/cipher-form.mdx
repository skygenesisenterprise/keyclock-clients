# Cipher Form

The cipher form is a re-usable form component that can be used to create, update, and clone ciphers.
It is configured via a `CipherFormConfig` object that is passed to the component as a prop. The
`CipherFormConfig` object can be created manually, or a `CipherFormConfigService` can be used to
create it. A default implementation of the `CipherFormConfigService` exists in the
`@bitwarden/vault` library.

The cipher form has a slot for `attachment-button`, which should be included when the form is in
`edit` mode.
